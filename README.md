In this project we have explore the dataset which includes city hotel and resort hotel.
In this dataset there are about 119390 rows and 32 columns on the whole. Since there are some duplicate datas hence we have removed duplicates to clean the data for better understanding.
All the required columns are divided into three types of datasets initially is Float, int, object. As we have modified one of the columns into datatime format from object to get better understanding of the specific column.
We have created three different columns namely Total_stay_night, Total_people_stay and new_ratings. Based upon the datasets to get clear insights.
We have used fillna function in agent and company columns to fill 0 interms of Null which helps to make datatypes from object to float. To get clear insights.
We also used describe function to find statistical insights for our datasets.

We also find unique values for each variable for our insights.

We have used group by function to identify the max, sum , and mean for different columns to get better understanding of provided datasets.
We have used different types of visualisation to get better insights for our datasets.
